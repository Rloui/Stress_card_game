Chosing Data Structure
- for the cards an object should be used be cause it will have three properties, keys: color, suit, and values
- use a class to create the blueprint for each card object

Directions

Problems Encountered:
- when rendering the hand and middle card arrays the correct suits are not rendering to the correct card
        -something is going on with the classes and how when I add a class 2 classe end up on the same div and the latter class take control of the image presented which isnt the right class

- there is a problem with my click function when the user clicks on 2 cards from their hand in a row or middle card it stores those card positions and in turn messing up the swap. Right now you have to alternate only clicking middle card and then a pile card and vice versa

- the winning conditions are based on the rank of the card because of the previous problem I was not able to work on this. If I were to do this I would make a loop that compares the first card of a pile to the rest of the cards of that pile and repeat this for every hand

- also all aspects of the page are not responsive, only some elements are. This in turn shifts the rows, columns, and headers of the game
